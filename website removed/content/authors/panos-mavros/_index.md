Trained in architecture, spatial cognition and mobile psychophysiological methods I am currently working as a postdoc at the Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore, working with the Chair of Cognitive Science of ETH ZÃ¼rich and leading the project [**A Neuroscientific Investigation of Crowdedness and Environmental typology**](pmavros.github.io/NICE_project) ðŸ§™ (NICE), together with Dominique Makowski. 

My research interests are the intersection of architectural and urban design with the psychological experience of spaces, combining spatial analysis and behavioural science methods and using mobile psychophysiological methods to understand how we feel in different spaces.
