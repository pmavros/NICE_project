### History and Philosophy

Neuropsychology and its connected disciplines are an evolving science, with a fascinating history and an exciting future. I do believe that in order to be able to push the boundaries of our field into uncharted territories, one must be endowed with some level of knowledge and understanding of the historical perspective and of the trajectories of ideas that we are part of. As such, I'm interested in exploring the roots of our current theories, excavating ancient perspectives that resonate with today's interpretations and connecting the past with the present to chart our march onwards.

- **Examples**: *Alfred Binetâ€™s answer on the value of aesthesiometry (tactile sensitivity) as an objective measure of mental fatigue* [(Nicolas and Makowski, 2016)](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/nicolas2016can/).
- **Keywords**: *History of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience; Contribution of ancient philosophies to modern science*

### Data Analysis and Statistics

Today's (and future's) psychological methods largely take the form of software, code and algorithms. I am interested in developing and exploring the usage of cutting-edge statistical methods and theoretical frameworks (Bayesian statistics, machine learning, ...) to answer challenges. By developing user-friendly tools and software to help users with their data analysis, I hope to promote the implementation of methodological best practices to elevate the quality standards of the field.

- **Examples**: *Indices of Effect Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework* [(Makowski et al., 2019)](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2019indices/).
- **Keywords**: *Programming; Bayesian framework; Statistical best practices; Open science*


### Methods and Tools

My research is methodologically located at the crossroads of traditional experimental neuropsychology (developing and using elegantly designed cognitive tests) and modern cognitive neuroscience (heavily relying on neuroimaging devices). Within this landscape, I am interested in promoting the combined usage of a large variety of techniques (bodily signals, neurophysiological activity, brain stimulation...), as much as I am dedicated to creating new tasks and measures to measure the process of interest. Finally, I am fascinated by "non-invasive" (a poor qualifier) techniques of brain stimulation, which can include the induction of altered states of consciousness via meditation or transcendental practices, or by the engagement in neo-realities (for instance using virtual reality).

- **Examples**: *The heart of cognitive control: Cardiac phase modulates processing speed and inhibition* [(Makowski et al., 2019)](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2019heart/).
- **Keywords**: *Cognitive tasks development; Multimodal neurophysiological recordings; Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques*
