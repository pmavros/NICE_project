In 1896, the Lumi√®re brothers presented a 50-seconds long movie of a train's arrival at a station. Intense fear and awe rose up among the audience, as if they could not believe that it was not a real train. Several decades later, the edges of our reality still continue to fade. Through virtual reality, augmented reality, deep fakes and new forms of fictions, simulations of all kind populate our everyday experience and challenge our intuitive *feeling* and *belief* concerning its reality.

### Reality Believing

One of the component of the sense of reality takes the form of a more or less explicit belief that we hold regarding the information that we process. Is it **"real" vs. "unreal"**? Qualifiers that in this context are umbrella terms for adjectives such as genuine, authentic, true or on the contrary fake, fictional, forged and virtual.

- **Keywords**: *Fiction, Fake News, Reality beliefs, Deep Fakes*

### Reality Feeling

Another more embodied, implicit dimension of the sense of reality is the feeling of reality.

- **Keywords**: *Presence, Immersion, Interoception, Virtual/Augmented Reality*

### Deception, lying and manipulation

The modulation of reality could also be connected to everyday processes, such as deceptive behaviours and lies. However, the creation and detection of information made with the purpose of fooling another might require a different set of cognitive processes, such as empathy, theory of mind, and planning.

### Role of Emotions

Reality bending also shares a strong relationship with emotional processing, modifications of the sense of reality might be at stake in some forms of voluntary or involuntary emotion regulation mechanisms (such as distancing, decoupling, defusion, decentering or fictional reappraisal).

- **Keywords**: *Emotions, Interoception, Emotion Regulation*

### Altered states of consciousness

- **Keywords**: *Meditation, Transcendental Experiences, Neuropsychiatric Disorders (schizophrenia, PTSD, depersonalisation-derealization disorder), (Lucid) Dreams, Minimal consciousness*
