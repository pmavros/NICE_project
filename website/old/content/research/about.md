**Summary**. Our conscious experience of reality being highly flexible, we study the mechanisms that lead to its distortion, and explore how reality alterations can in turn inform us about our Selves. Find out more about [**what is reality bending** here](https://realitybending.github.io/post/2020-09-28-what_is_realitybending/).

<!-- Though very diverse by their approach, methods or topics, our studies aim to explore the very core of what it is like to **be in the world**. In other words, we study the fundamental levels of consciousness and the Self in relationship with its internal and external environment. -->

**Topics**. This includes investigating the role of active mechanisms (e.g. cognitive control, emotions, interoception, immersion, meditation, deception...) in shaping our **sense of reality** (i.e., the feeling and belief that we - and our environment - are real), as well as their crystallised form giving rise to dispositional characteristics in the form of **personality** phenotypes and **neuropsychological profiles**. Additionally, we develop **novel methods** (advanced statistical algorithms, tasks and tests) and apply **cutting-edge techniques** (multimodal neurophysiological recordings) to gain insight into the processes at stake. Finally, we try to understand our research in a larger **historical**, epistemological and philosophical frame.

**Approach**. We place ourselves within a [**neuropsychological perspective**](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/what_is_neuropsychology/); we analyse and dissect the phenomena of interest in terms of dynamic interaction between neurocognitive mechanisms and brain processes, and aim at validating and/or extending our results to particular populations, such as patients suffering from neuropsychiatric conditions.
