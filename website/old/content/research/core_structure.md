We are complex organisms which inter-individual unicity is blatantly salient, as demonstrated by the tremendous variability of behaviours, beliefs and experiences. And yet, it seems that the subtle combination of shared features in regards to heritage and experiences results in pseudo-similar patterns of being, that can be isolated and described as "traits", "types", "profiles", or "disorders".

Whether natural or artificial categories and dimensions, I am interested in pursuing the ancient quest for the description and classification of such profiles of being. I hope to extend this search beyond concepts like "personality types" and "cognitive profiles" by incorporating the core neurocognitive processes at play in multiple layers of the Self, and see how they unfold into metastable characteristics.


### Neural \& Psychological Assessment

In this journey, the first step is to try gaining access to one's core Self via objective behavioural measurements, which encompasses the development of new - or improvement of existing - measures (questionnaires, cognitive tasks, ...).

### Contribution of Neurocognitive Processes to Personality

The relationship between high-level personality (in its very large sense of typical behaviour) and lower-level aspects of the Self (measured at an inter-individual level), including cognitive abilities (e.g., response inhibition), neural wiring (e.g., features of the predictive coding system) and embodied processes (e.g., interoception) is an under-investigated question. I focus on the contribution of cognitive control and interoception to mid-level mechanisms like emotion regulation and self-control and high-level personality profiles.

### Multidimensional Structure

As most of the core dimensions constitutive of our Self are likely to be individually continuous in nature, the distribution of individuals in the multidimensional space that they create together remains an open questions. Are we evenly spread, or are there densely populated subspaces, i.e., in statistical multivariate clusters, that would justify categorical approaches to personality.
