Trained as neuropsychologist, CBT psychotherapist <sub><sup>(*and* [***others***](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/cv/#titles-and-licenses))</sup></sub>, I am currently a researcher at the [**Clinical Brain Lab**](http://www.clinicalbrain.org/) in Singapore under the [Presidential Postdoc Fellowship](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/tracs/ppf/Pages/home_PPF.aspx), working (mainly) on the neuroscience of deception :smirk:.

 I'm fluent in French, English, Polish, Python, and currently learning Italian. My main figures of reference are
Marcus Aurelius, Hannibal Lecter and Yoda. My interests include scientific methodology, history of art and religion, as well as philosophy. My research focuses on aspects of [**reality bending**](research/) (e.g., fiction, deception or altered states of consciousness such as through meditation or immersion).
