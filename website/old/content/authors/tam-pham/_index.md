I graduated from Nanyang Technological University with a BA (Hons) Highest Distinction in Psychology in 2018 and has since been doing research on neurophysiological basis of deception.
While I'm interested in studying why people engage in behaviours that are harmful to themselves, I also have strong interests in signal processing and statistics.
