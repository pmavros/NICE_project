I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Master of Arts (Honours) in Psychology with First Class Honours in 2019. I am broadly interested in clinical neuropsychology, specifically regarding the interplay of memory, decision-making, and emotional dysfunction in mental and neurological disorders. At Clinical Brain Lab, I work on projects investigating the cognitive neuroscience of deception and am also an avid contributor of several open-source softwares.
