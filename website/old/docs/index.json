Despite the wide use of electrocardiograms (ECG) in research and advancements in sensor technology, the analytical approach and steps applied to obtain HRV measures can be seen as complex. Thus, this poses a challenge to users who may not have the adequate background knowledge to obtain the HRV indices reliably. To maximize the impact of HRV-related research and its reproducibility, parallel advances in users‚Äô understanding of the indices and the standardization of analysis pipelines in its utility will be crucial. This paper addresses this gap and aims to provide an overview of the most up-to-date and commonly used HRV indices, as well as common research areas in which these indices have proven to be very useful, particularly in psychology. In addition, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to perform HRV analysis using an integrative neurophysiological toolkit, NeuroKit2.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2021 - Heart Rate Variability in Psychology: A Review of HRV Indices and an Analysis Tutorial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["R","Reproducibility"],"content":"How to share data analysis scripts with publications? Including data analysis as Supplementary Materials can be a tedious task. How can we simplify the sharing of our work? So that it can be fully appreciated, as well as evaluated, improved, worked on, in a transparent and open way?\nOption 1: Dump the code in a word file Most publication portals don\u0026rsquo;t directly accept code scripts to be included \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;. In other words, you cannot upload your manuscript and your .R script just like that. So one option is to copy its content, paste it in a word / pdf document, and Voil√†!\nBut what if you don\u0026rsquo;t have code because you use a point-and-click software? Well, you can note down all the x,y coordinates of your clicks so that one can reproduce the steps and all the clicks. Just kidding, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a script, then may god have mercy on your soul.\nWhy is that a terrible solution? Because let\u0026rsquo;s face it, unstructured code dumps are horrific. Nobody wants to read it, it does not make justice to your work, and it\u0026rsquo;s still tedious to create! You have to re-do it everytime you modify your code. And it\u0026rsquo;s even worse if you want to include all the outputs, figures, tables that are generated by the code? Data analysis is not just the code, but everything that comes with it and that allowed you to make the conclusions that you made.\nOption 2: Use Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a \u0026ldquo;framework\u0026rdquo; that allows you to have files (.Rmd) that can contain a mix of text and code (and not only R, but also Python for instance!).\nIt can be used to write comprehensive \u0026ldquo;reports\u0026rdquo; that include all your thoughts, motivations and interpretations of the results. And the great thing about it is that these files can be converted into beautiful and readable documents like PDF, Word or HTML. It will automatically embed the code and its generated output (as text, tables or figures) alongside the text.\nIt is an awesome way to write statistical reports, and can even be used to create many other non-stats related stuff, like APA-formatted manuscripts (great for preprints), books, presentation slides, websites or blogs. It\u0026rsquo;s a must-have skill for every researcher.\nAnd it gets better!\nOption 3: Use our Results Template In the Reality Bending team, we like to have our different projects and studies organized in a consistent way. We heavily use GitHub to store our projects and collaborate on them, and we also like the possibility of making these projects open and accessible (i.e., easy to discover and explore) when the time comes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we came up with a Template folder for storing the materials related to a given study, including well-organized analysis scripts. And what\u0026rsquo;s great about it is that it is setup in a way that allows you to generate multiple files format (word, pdf, html) with a single click (and even without any click, in a fully automatic way)! And what\u0026rsquo;s even greater is that if you decide to upload it to GitHub, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a whole website presenting your data analysis!\nWe use it to have reproducible analysis that we can easily share with publications. We can upload the .pdf or .docx file generated by the template as Supplementary Materials, but we also link the URL of the online repository of the study in the manuscript, where users can access and experience the content in the format that they prefer. It really improves the appeal of a study when the results are trustworthy.\nAll this is easily made possible with our template. Check it out here:\nüëâ https://github.com/RealityBending/TemplateResults üëà\n‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è\nAnd let us know what you think!

It provides a comprehensive suite of processing routines for a variety of bodily signals (e.g., ECG, PPG, EDA, EMG, RSP). These processing routines include high-level functions that enable data processing in a few lines of code using validated pipelines, which we illustrate in two examples covering the most typical scenarios, such as an event-related paradigm and an interval-related analysis. The package also includes tools for specific processing steps such as rate extraction and filtering methods, offering a trade-off between high-level convenience and fine-tuned control. Its goal is to improve transparency and reproducibility in neurophysiological research, as well as foster exploration and innovation. Its design philosophy is centred on user-experience and accessibility to both novice and advanced users.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2021 - NeuroKit2: A Python toolbox for neurophysiological signal processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["Art","Neuropsychology"],"content":"Name One Thing In This Photo Can you name one thing in the image above? It all looks familiar, but something is off. The image makes \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; overall; there are well-defined shapes and objects, that seem to be placed in a plausible - albeit chaotic - fashion, like some random rubbish thrown in the corner of a room. Even the colors, the lightning, the quality, is coherent, and helps making it believable. And yet, chances are you cannot name one single element that composes it.\nThis image, after appearing on twitter in April 2019, surfaced on reddit with the caption \u0026ldquo;This picture is designed to give the viewer the simulated experience of having a stroke (particularly in the occipital lobe of the cerebral cortex, where visual perception occurs.) Everything looks hauntingly familiar but you just can\u0026rsquo;t quite recognize anything\u0026rdquo;, and became subsequently viral. However, the author of the caption later admitted that he made this description up.\nSo where does the image come from?\nOne can trace back the original publication to an instagram account, which author declared having made the image using ArtBreeder.com. This website gives access to an AI algorithm (Generative Adversarial Networks - GAN), commonly used in the processing and generation of images (one mindblowing example can be found on thispersondoesnotexist.com, which generates realistic pictures of non-existing people). There were even some attempts to reverse engineer the process to retrieve what the original image could have been like.\nAfter all, it seems like there is no intelligent design behind this image. No clever neuropsychologist carefully crafting a meaningful experience. Just one of these lucky accident.\nNonetheless, it\u0026rsquo;s still an intriguing image, falling in this uncanny abyss of things that we recognize as familiar, but slightly too alien for our sense-seeking brains to dissolve in meaning. Could it tell something about brain processes? Surely, but brain disorders? Maybe.\nThe \u0026ldquo;occipital stroke\u0026rdquo; hypothesis mentioned above suggests, by its formulation, a lesion to the primary visual cortices. However, as neuroscientists know, these brain regions, located at the extreme back of the brain, are mostly supporting lower level aspects of visual processing, and their damage is usually related to alterations of a somewhat different nature than of that above, such as vision loss, visual hallucinations, visual deformations, loss of color, movement, stereoscopy, etc.\nHowever, there is another neuropsychological disorder, referred to as \u0026ldquo;visual agnosia\u0026rdquo;, in which patients experience difficulties to recognize visually presented objects, despite preserving an intact vision. In fact, it is more an umbrella term for different subcategories of deficits, and the image above could be reminiscent of visual agnosia of the associative type, which corresponds to a a specific impairment in the assignment of meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived (and can be visually described). This symptom is often related to injuries in the left occipito-temporal region, located on the ventral \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; stream of the brain (as opposed to the so-called \u0026ldquo;where\u0026rdquo; dorsal stream).\nIvan Seal\u0026rsquo;s Art From there, the youtuber Solar Sands helped me discover the artist Ivan Seal, which work is somewhat akin to the image above. They are not purely abstract renditions, or depictions of impossible entities, but plausible objects that sit in this awkward space, deep between boring reality and total weirdness.\n Thanks for reading!

However, it is not (yet) a well-established scientific topic, nor is it clearly defined. In fact, it is not defined at all, hence the purpose of this article.\nBut what does it refer too? Is it some kind of Avatar: The Last Airbender thing? Or some Avengers-style superpower? Well\u0026hellip; I sure wish it was üòÅ\nEssentially, reality bending refers to the study of the internal and external determinants of subjective reality. In other words, we seek to understand the processes that modulate our conscious experience of reality. The word \u0026ldquo;bending\u0026rdquo; encapsulates the active nature of the mechanisms at stake. Indeed, being anything but stable, our perception of reality can be quite easily influenced, whether voluntarily or not, sometimes to extreme degrees of alteration.\n\rDaumier, H. (1925), Don Quixote attacking the windmills.\r\rReality benders seek to unravel the structure and mechanisms of the sense of reality by studying natural instances of its distortion, or by directly inducing them through a variety of means.\nObjective and subjective determinants of the sense of reality Let\u0026rsquo;s take for example a guy watching some episode of his favourite TV show, Friends. As he swiftly moves from laughing to snivelling, we can confidently say that he is fully immersed in the show. He feels like he\u0026rsquo;s present in the show, from which the fictional characters feel very real: for a moment, his brain processes the perceived experience almost as if it was real.\nWhat leads to this high sense of reality? First, there are objective characteristics of the experience (or rather, of the external source of the experience), i.e., characteristics of the environment. Here, it\u0026rsquo;s a realistic stimulus displayed on a flat screen. But one could wonder what would happen if the sensory input was richer (imagine being physically IN the show by means of some super virtual reality setup), or poorer (the same story presented as comic strips with the characters portrayed as stick figures).\nHowever, while such manipulations could indeed be used to manipulate our immersion, there is also a subjective component contributing to our sense of reality, related for instance to the affective response, attentional engagement, or self-relevance, that will cause a stimulus to strum unique strings in each individual, depending on his history and state of mind.\nTell me your reality and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who you are The fact that the sense of reality is, in the end, a subjective experience, means that is is intrinsically connected to the Self (i.e., our physical and mental identity). As such, aside from studying how our sense of reality is influenced by external and internal factors, but also investigate the reverse relationship, i.e., how the variability of our sense of reality can inform us about oneself.\nNote that, although the focus is the subjective aspect of reality, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we deny the existence, or downplay the importance, of objective reality. Stating that most of our experience is \u0026ldquo;made-up\u0026rdquo; (i.e., is a construction of the brain) does not equate absolute relativism (more on that in another post). Objective truths and facts do exist, and are essential to seek.\nAltered states of consciousness Naturally, states in which our sense of reality is distorted (as compared to the consensual collective experience) are of particular interest as models or study-cases of our ideas and theories. They include long-term affections (e.g., neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) or transcient states (induced by psychoactive substances or specific practices like meditation and trance).\n Thanks for reading!

This ability encompasses various emotion regulation strategies, such as fictional reappraisal, at stake whenever one engages in fictional works (e.g., movies, books, video games, virtual environments). Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance. Implications for the neuroscientific study of implicit emotion regulation are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - Phenomenal, bodily and brain correlates of fictional reappraisal as an implicit emotion regulation strategy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Serge Nicolas","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"69e96af8d3e0329fe295d483a9aae0ce","permalink":"/publication/makowski2017being/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2017being/","section":"publication","summary":"Few studies have investigated the link between episodic memory and presence: the feeling of \"being there\" and reacting to a stimulus as if it were real. We collected data from 244 participants after they had watched the movie Avengers: Age of Ultron. They answered questions about factual (details of the movie) and temporal memory (order of the scenes) about the movie, as well as their emotion experience and their sense of presence during the projection. Both higher emotion experience and sense of presence were related to better factual memory, but not to temporal order memory. Crucially, the link between emotion and factual memory was mediated by the sense of presence. We interpreted the role of presence as an external absorption of the attentional focus toward the stimulus, thus enhancing memory encoding. Our findings could shed light on the cognitive processes underlying memory impairments in psychiatric conditions characterized by an altered sense of reality.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - \"Being there\" and remembering it: Presence improves memory encoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Margherita Arcangeli","Prany Wantzen","Tiziana Zalla","Stephane Lemaire","Jerome Dokic","Jerome Pelletier","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"42c876946832642a35d0a80fe18964ed","permalink":"/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","section":"publication","summary":"Several theoretical models stress the role of executive functions in emotion regulation (ER). However, most of the previous studies on ER employed explicit regulatory strategies that could have engaged executive functions, beyond regulatory processes per se. Recently, there has been renewed interest in implicit forms of ER, believed to be closer to daily-life requirements. While various studies have shown that implicit and explicit ER engage partially overlapping neurocognitive processes, the contribution of different executive functions in implicit ER has not been investigated. In the present study, we presented participants with negatively valenced pictures of varying emotional intensity preceded by short texts describing them as either fictional or real. This manipulation was meant to induce a spontaneous emotional down-regulation. We recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) and subjective reports of emotion arousal. Executive functions (updating, switching, and inhibition) were also assessed. No difference was found between the fictional and real condition on EDA. A diminished self-reported arousal was observed, however, when pictures were described as fictional for high- and mild-intensity material, but not for neutral material. The amount of down-regulation in the fictional condition was found to be predicted by interindividual variability in updating performances, but not by the other measures of executive functions, suggesting its implication even in implicit forms of ER. The relationship between down-regulation and updating was significant only for high-intensity material. We discuss the role of updating in relation to the consciousness of one's emotional state.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - The distinctive role of executive functions in implicit emotion regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Margherita Arcangeli","Dominique Makowski","Prany Wantzen","Tiziana Zalla","St√©phane Lemaire","J√©r√¥me Dokic","J√©r√¥me Pelletier","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"808542b09ed5f93bfe16f98c3321be47","permalink":"/publication/sperduti2016paradox/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2016paradox/","section":"publication","summary":"For over forty years, philosophers have struggled with the ‚Äúparadox of fiction‚Äù, which is the issue of how we can get emotionally involved with fictional characters and events. The few neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have evidenced that midline cortical structures and lateral fronto-parietal regions are more engaged for real and fictional entities, respectively. Interestingly, the former network is engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference, processes that are known to boost emotional reactivity, while the latter underpins emotion regulation. Thus, a possible modulation of the emotional response according to the nature (real or fictional) of the stimulus is conceivable. To test this hypothesis, we presented short emotional (negative and positive) and neutral video as fictional or real. For negative material, we found that subjective emotional experience, but not physiological arousal measured by electrodermal activity, was reduced in the fictional condition. Moreover, the amount of personal memories linked to the scenes counteracted this effect boosting the subjective emotional response. On the contrary, personal memories elicited by the scenes, but not fiction, modulate the emotional response for positive material. These results suggest that when a stimulus triggers a personal memory, the emotional response is less prone to be modulated by contextual factors, and suggest that personal engagement could be responsible for emotional reaction toward fiction. We discuss these results in the emotion regulation framework and underline their implications in informing theoretical accounts of emotion in the neuroscientific domain and the philosophical debate on the paradox of emotional response to fiction.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The paradox of fiction: Emotional response toward fiction and the modulatory role of self-relevance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b1d532d62aa5089478581d97d951945e","permalink":"/project/neurokit/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neurokit/","section":"project","summary":"A Python toolbox for neurophysiological signal processing","tags":["Python"],"title":"NeuroKit","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa2c6ea6e64b8013bd8e57962f6d1563","permalink":"/project/pyllusion/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pyllusion/","section":"project","summary":"A Python module for generating visual illusions","tags":["Python"],"title":"Pyllusion","type":"project"}]
